#  ðŸ§ªðŸš€ REST and SOAP API testing via Postman 

1) I've thoroughly examined all the functions offered by the https://petstore.swagger.io/ API using Postman, and I've organized these tests into dedicated collections:
 <ul>
<li>  Petstore REST <a href="https://www.postman.com/maintenance-technologist-21777939/workspace/api-task-roman-p/collection/27346396-77be6048-3a6a-4493-ae32-dcbfed0fec41?action=share&creator=27346396">Postman collection</a>  </li>
<li>   "Store" section <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16N_RE8N9w0XXkvvcL625BgHbZ_XxeuyOvFgIb616o_o/edit?usp=sharing">Testcases </a>   </li>
</ul>

2) I've successfully created a functional Postman collection using the provided <a href="http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL">WSDL</a>. This collection allows you to retrieve various types of information about a country, including its currency, comprehensive details, and specific language-related information. I created a working collection in Postman that can be used to determine: a country's currency, full country information, and country-specific language information: 
 <ul>
<li> SOAP <a href="https://www.postman.com/maintenance-technologist-21777939/workspace/api-task-roman-p/collection/27346396-7a098270-e1d0-4cac-8b65-0ee26e85ced1?action=share&creator=27346396">Postman collection</a>   </li>
</ul>
